# End-to-end Adobe Stock Photo Search Demo

First, you'll need to get an API key from the Adobe console. Find the file named `apikey.json` in `./src` that looks like this:

```json
{
    "apikey": "..."
}
```

and enter your key there. Alternatively you can just paste the key in the Modal Dialog.

Then, to build:

install yarn (if needed) with
    npm install -g yarn

install dependencies with
    yarn install

watch and automatically rebuild with
    yarn watch

# Use

Select "Adobe Stock" > "Search Adobe Stock..." from the "Plugins" menu.
